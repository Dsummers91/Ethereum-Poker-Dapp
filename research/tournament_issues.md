## Problems with Decentralized Tournaments

2. [Table Reorganization](#table-reorg)
3. [Table Shards](#shards)

## Sybil Attack <a name="sybil-attack"></a>

Any user is able to have unlimited entries in tournaments due to ability to create inifite addresses, and participate in tournaments. Which could give unfair advantage as one person has more chances to win than someone else. 

Proof-of-Identity could be useful but would come at its own costs

## Table Re-organizations <a name="table-reorg"></a>
- [] How do members reach consensus that a table needs to be broken up and merge with other tables? 
- [] Who controls the randomness of choosing who goes to which table
- [] Does tournament need a central entity

## Table Shars <a name="shards"></a>
Tables need to be ran in unison but seperately, probably similar to current sharding implementations on ethereum mainchain

Only these need to eventually merge to one shard.
